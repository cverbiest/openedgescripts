Linux (bash) Scripts to share with the OE community

## No warranty
This is a spare time project. Comments, through the Progress communities site, are welcomed. Chances are that it will take a while before there is a response.
I share this project in the hope, but without any warranty, that it can be useful for some-one. Maybe it can serve as an example how certain tasks can be automated.

This project is written in bash
